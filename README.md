# LyrAssist

Overview of the Project -
LyrAssist is a web-based single-page application that allows the user to find the lyrics of a song and maybe even discover some new music along the way.

Users enter in a Song Name (or any word) and LyrAssist runs a query to the MusixMatch API and returns 10 results - all with the Track Name containing the queried word. The results display the Track Name and Artist Name in the form of Html-Cards. When the user clicks on the 'Get Lyrics' Button, LyrAssist sends another query to the MusixMatch API, using the Track ID, to retrieve and display 30% of the song lyrics to the user in the form of a Modal.
