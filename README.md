# LyrAssist

Overview of the Project
LyrAssist is a web-based application that allows you to find the lyrics of a song and maybe even discover some new music along the way.

Users enter in either a Song Name or any word and LyrAssist runs a query to the MusixMatch API and spits back 10 results - all with the Track Name containing the queried word. The results display the Track Name and Artist Name in the form of Html-Cards. When clicked, LyrAssist sends another query to the MusixMatch API, using the Track ID, to retrieve and display 30% of the song lyrics to the user.
